Last summer my boy Dan and I went to Colorado to hike some of the magnificent 14ers. During the trip I was able to finish 3 14ers: [Mt. Sherman (14043 ft)](https://www.strava.com/activities/7404834241/overview) and a continuous traverse across [Mt. Belford (14203) and Mt.Oxford (14160)](https://www.strava.com/activities/7416055695/overview). I hope to add more to the list!
