I first started running casually in 2020, mainly sticking to treadmills and small distances. When I moved out to florida, I started training for the [Orange Blossom 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/4858408023/overview), my first ever race! Since then I've also ran the [Golden Gate Half Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/8078553486/overview) (featured video), and my goal for 2023 is to run the San Francisco Marathon!
